\begin{answer}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../src/featuremaps/degk.png}
        \caption{Degree $k$ polynomial for $k=3, 5, 10, 20$}
    \end{figure}
    Observation: the higher the degree, the better it fits the data. However, it also becomes more prone to overfitting, as
    seen in the $k=20$ case at around $x=6$.
\end{answer}
