\begin{answer}
    As the plots included in parts (b) and (e) shown, the two predictions
    look similar for dataset 2. 

    GDA seem to perform worse than logistic regression on dataset 1. The reason
    may be that the data is not Guassian distributed. Logistic regression performs
    better when the data is not Guassian distributed.
